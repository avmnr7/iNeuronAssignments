## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

   Python is a general purpose language because it is used in various fields like Machine learning,Data Science,Web Development,Data Analysis ,AI and so on.
   It is a high-level language because it's easy for humans to understand and it is obejct oriented approach.
  
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
    Python called a dynamically typed language because of interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.
    
   
Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Pros	
   Highly Scalable
   Flexible and Extensible	
   Extensive Libraries	
   Embeddable	
   Portable
Cons
   Slower than compiled languages
   Security
   Pythonâ€™s Memory Consumption and Garbage Collection
   High memory consumption
   Python is Dynamically Typed

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

   Python can use in various domains
   Data analysis and visualizations
   Programming applications
   AI and machine learning
   Financial analysis and fintechs
   Game development
   
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
     In Python, variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to variable ,we can refer to the object by that name.
     In Python we don't declare variables, we simply assign them.
     
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

      Using input() function

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

     String

Q8. What is type casting?

 Changing one datatype to other data type is casting.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

 Using only with input function , No . but using input and split function we can get multiple inputs.
 
 name,age=input("Enter User details of name, age  is: ").split(",",2)
print("User name is :",name)
print("User age is :",age)



Q10. What are keywords?
     Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
     No. We cannot use keywords as varaibale.
     Example 
     if=5
   print("The value of if is ",if)
   It throws SyntaxError: invalid syntax  error


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Indentation is the leading whitespace (spaces or/and tabs) before any statement in Python. 
The reason why indentation is important in python is that the indentation serves another purpose other than code readability. 
Python treats the statements with the same indentation level (statements with an equal number of whitespaces before them) as a single code block.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
      Using print() function
      
Q14. What are operators in Python?
   Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Some of them areArithmetic operators
   Assignment operators
    Comparison operators
   Logical operators
   Identity operators
   Membership operators
  Bitwise operators
  
Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

     /  for float division
     // for integer divison 


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```   print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

    number1=int(input("Please enter the number to test whether ever or odd: "))
    if (num1%2==0):
        print("The given number %d is even"%(num1),end="\n")
    else:    
        print("The given number %d is odd"%(num1),end="\n")
        
Q18. What are boolean operator?
     Boolean operators are those that take Boolean inputs and return Boolean results.
     The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. 
     While and as well as or operator needs two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, not operator needs one operand evaluating to true or false.

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0
output:  1
0 and 0
Output:0
True and False and True
Output: False
1 or 0 or 0
Output: 1

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

if.
if..else.
Nested if.
if-elif statements

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

In a Python program, the if or elif statements are used to perform this sort of decision-making. It allows for conditional execution of a statement or group of statements 
or group of statements based on the value of an expression. Else statement is  if all the above conditions evalutes to false.


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
age=int(input("Please enter the age to check voting right: "))
if (age>=18):
    print("I can vote")
else:    
    print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

print("The sum of numbers give in the list is : ",sum(numbers))




Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

num1=int(input("Please enter the first number: "))
num2=int(input("Please enter the second number: "))
num3=int(input("Please enter the third number: "))
if (num1>num2) and (num1>num3):
    print("The greatest of %d,%d,%d is %d "%(num1,num2,num3,num1))
elif (num2>num3) and (num2>num3):
    print("The greatest of %d,%d,%d is %d "%(num1,num2,num3,num2))
else:
    print("The greatest of %d,%d,%d is %d "%(num1,num2,num3,num3))


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if((i%5)==0):
        if(500>i>150 ):
            continue
        if(i>500):
            break
        
        print("The number divisible by 5 is ",i)
