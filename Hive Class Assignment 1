1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

Solution:

create table sales_order_csv(ORDERNUMBER int,QUANTITYORDERED int,PRICEEACH float,ORDERLINENUMBER  int,SALES float,STATUS string,QTR_ID int,MONTH_ID int,YEAR_ID int,PRODUCTLINE string,MSRP int,PRODUCTCODE string,PHONE string,CITY string,STATE string,POSTALCODE string,COUNTRY string,TERRITORY string,CONTACTLASTNAME string,CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,DEALSIZE string) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde' WITH SERDEPROPERTIES( "seperatorchar"=",") STORED AS TEXTFILE tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");

load data local inpath 'file:///config/workspace/sales_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv;

 select * from sales_order_csv limit 5;

create table sales_order_orc(ORDERNUMBER int,QUANTITYORDERED int,PRICEEACH float,ORDERLINENUMBER  int,SALES float,STATUS string,QTR_ID int,MONTH_ID int,YEAR_ID int,PRODUCTLINE string,MSRP int,PRODUCTCODE string,PHONE string,CITY string,STATE string,POSTALCODE string,COUNTRY string,TERRITORY string,CONTACTLASTNAME string,CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,DEALSIZE string) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.OpenCSVSerde' WITH SERDEPROPERTIES( "seperatorchar"=",") STORED AS ORC  tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");

insert into table sales_order_orc select * from sales_order_csv;


a)select year_id,sum(sales) sumsales from sales_order_csv group by year_id;

b)select productline,quantityordered from sales_order_csv order by quantityordered DESC LIMIT 1;
c)select QRT_ID,sum(sales) sumofsales from sales_order_csv group by QRT_ID;
d)select QRT_ID,sales  from sales_order_csv  QRT_ID order by sales LIMIT 1;
e)select country,sales  from sales_order_csv  order by sales desc limit 1;
select country,sales  from sales_order_csv  order by sales  limit 1;
f)select city,qtr_id,sum(sales) from sales_order_csv group by city,qtr_id;
g)select year_id,month_id,QUANTITYORDERED from sales_order_csv order by quantityordered DESC LIMIT 1;
